# Loom Free Plan Features and Limitations

Loom has revolutionized how teams capture and share visual content through its intuitive screen recording tool. From entrepreneurs to enterprise teams, millions rely on Loom's powerful platform to create, collaborate, and communicate more effectively. While the paid plans unlock comprehensive features for serious creators, the free tier remains a crucial entry point for individual users and small teams testing the platform's capabilities. In this article, we'll explore exactly what you can (and can't) do with Loom's free plan, comparing its limitations to the premium offerings that power Loom's enterprise success.


## Video Storage and Processing Limits

The free plan's video storage capacity is limited to 25 videos, including any archived recordings. Once this limit is reached, users will no longer be able to make new recordings until some existing videos are deleted. The current video count displays next to the Library search bar, providing immediate visibility into remaining capacity.

Each video is restricted to a maximum length of 5 minutes, which affects users who require longer recording durations for their presentations or demonstrations. This limitation impacts content creators who may need to split longer sessions into multiple recordings, potentially increasing the complexity of their workflow.

The free plan supports unlimited screenshot functionality, allowing users to capture visual assets without video constraints. However, this balance reflects the fundamental difference in intended usage between free and paid tiers - the free tier prioritizes basic functionality for casual users or small teams, while premium tiers scale to support enterprise needs with unlimited videos and extended recording capabilities.


## Basic Functionality and Workflow

The free plan enables users to record presentations and demonstrations with screen capture functionality, including webcam integration through the "cam bubble" feature. Recordings automatically include transcriptions across over 50 languages, providing real-time captions for improved accessibility and easier content review.

Users can trim and stitch multiple recordings together, though the 5-minute maximum video length restricts single recording sessions. The automatic transcription feature works across all recorded content, supporting quick search and navigation within long presentations.


### Collaboration and Sharing

The free tier includes basic collaboration features, allowing up to 50 Creator lite members within each workspace. Recordings automatically gain privacy controls that help manage access, though viewer interaction capabilities are limited compared to paid tiers. Basic viewer engagement features include comments and reactions, enabling recipients to provide feedback directly within the recorded content.


### Workflow Efficiency

Users experience standard recording quality at 720P, with no access to custom dimensions or advanced editing tools. This limitation forces content creators to manage files within the 5-minute restriction, potentially complicating workflows for longer content needs. Drawing, mouse emphasis, and blur tools remain unavailable in the free tier, further affecting content creation flexibility.

The free plan's basic feature set prioritizes simplicity and accessibility for individual users and small teams, focusing on core screen recording needs without the advanced functionality available in paid tiers. This tier serves as an entry point for users to evaluate Loom's value proposition before committing to premium services.


## Viewer Interaction Capabilities

The free plan restricts viewer interaction to basic comment and reaction capabilities. These features enable recipients to provide feedback directly within the recorded content, though the limited scope reflects the fundamental differences in intended usage between free and paid tiers.


### Collaboration and Sharing

Creator Lite members in free workspaces have access to basic video sharing features, though administrators can control viewer capabilities through workspace settings. When download restrictions are enabled by Enterprise workspace administrators, free plan users lose the ability to download videos entirely, regardless of settings.

The free plan's viewer interaction features support the lightweight collaboration model prioritizing individual and small team use. This functionality enables basic audience engagement while maintaining control over content availability and distribution through workspace settings and privacy controls.


## Comparison with Paid Plans

The free plan's limitations become particularly apparent when compared to the Business and Enterprise tiers. While the free plan offers basic functionality for individual users and small teams, the premium plans scale significantly to support enterprise needs.


### Unlimited Versus Limited Features

Business subscribers gain immediate access to features restricted to the free tier's 5-minute video length limit and 25-video storage capacity. The Business plan removes these constraints entirely, enabling continuous recording and unlimited storage. Enterprise customers receive the same benefits as Business subscribers, plus advanced content management capabilities including custom data retention policies and advanced privacy controls.


### AI and Advanced Tools

The Business + AI tier introduces automated features missing from the free plan, such as filler word removal and AI-generated content improvements. While the free plan provides automatic transcriptions across over 50 languages, the premium tiers enhance this with structured chapter creation and improved summarization tools. These AI-powered features represent the primary differentiators in content production efficiency and scalability.


### Collaboration and Team Features

Small teams benefit from the free tier's 50 Creator lite member limit, but grow beyond this when needing extensive collaboration. Business and Enterprise plans expand workspace sizes, allowing organizations to manage larger teams efficiently. The Business plan introduces priority support and customized branding options, while Enterprise customers gain advanced SSO capabilities and Salesforce integration for seamless workflow management.


### Recording and Editing Improvements

Users seeking higher video quality or more editing freedom find significant improvements in the paid tiers. The Business plan offers full HD up to 4K recording, while Enterprise customers maintain this quality without usage restrictions. Custom video dimensions, advanced drawing tools, and mouse emphasis features become essential for professional content creation, expanding the free plan's basic screen capture capabilities.


### Integration and Sharing Enhancements

The free tier enables integration with common tools like Slack, GitHub, and Notion, but paid plans extend this capability significantly. Business subscribers can embed videos directly, manage password-protected content, and track user engagement metrics comprehensively. Enterprise users benefit from enhanced content privacy, including granular access controls and boundary restrictions that protect sensitive information beyond organizational limits.
