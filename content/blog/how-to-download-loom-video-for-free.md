# Downloading Loom Videos

Loom has revolutionized the way we share and consume short-form videos through its intuitive platform and AI-powered features. However, questions often arise about the platform's approach to video ownership, download capabilities, and the implications of restricted access. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore who can download Loom videos, how to initiate the process when available, and what limitations users should be aware of. We'll also look at alternative methods for capturing Loom content when direct downloads aren't possible, and provide practical solutions for common issues that may arise during the download and playback process.


## Understanding Loom Video Ownership and Download Permissions

Loom restricts video download capabilities based on account type and workspace permissions. Personal Loom accounts, including Creator Lite profiles in Business, Business+ AI, or Starter Free tiers, are prohibited from downloading any videos. Enterprise workspace members and administrators, Business workspace creators, and Education workspace administrators retain the ability to download videos directly from Loom's interface.

For personal Loom users who wish to download videos, the process requires specific permissions. After locating the desired video through the Loom dashboard or via shareable link, users must check for the presence of a "Download" button in the toolbar. This button appears only for video owners or creators who have granted permission. If the download button is visible, users can click it to initiate the process, with the video saved in standard MP4 format to the default Downloads directory.

When direct download options are not available, users must employ alternative methods. Loom does not permit downloading videos with Variables or recordings exceeding 20GB (approximately 3 hours in 4K resolution). As such, users seeking to retain video content must utilize screen recording software that can capture web-based content. Recommended alternatives include OBS Studio, Tella, and Camtasia, which allow precise control over recording parameters and output quality.


## Downloading Personal Loom Videos

The download feature for personal Loom videos appears in the toolbar below the video itself as a single button labeled "Download." When accessible, this button enables users to save videos directly to their device's default Downloads folder. The process begins automatically upon clicking the button, with the video being saved in standard MP4 format.

Viewer access to download functions depends entirely on the video owner's settings. Paid workspace creators and administrators have the ability to enable downloads within video settings, allowing viewers to access the download feature after signing into their Loom accounts. Regular viewers without an active Loom subscription are restricted from downloading videos, regardless of any settings that may be configured by the video owner.

Additional video limitations include restrictions on files containing Variables, which cannot be downloaded at all. Meeting recordings are similarly constrained, being accessible only to the meeting organizer. The platform enforces a strict 20GB size limit for downloadable content, which effectively caps the maximum recording length at approximately 3 hours in 4K resolution. While the download process typically completes quickly, a "Polishing pixels" message may appear briefly during file processing, indicating that the video is finalizing its upload before becoming available for download.


## Screen Recording Alternative for Unavailability

When direct download options are not available, users can employ screen recording software that Loom officially supports for both Mac and Windows platforms. Recommended alternatives include OBS Studio, Tella, and Camtasia, each with specific capabilities tailored to different needs.

OBS Studio, a popular open-source solution, offers comprehensive recording features including support for canvas recording, background blur tools, and precise control over recording settings. It runs natively on both Windows and Mac systems, making it accessible for most users.

Tella provides a more streamlined approach specifically designed for recording web content, making it particularly useful for capturing videos shared via Loom links. This software focuses on ease of use while maintaining high-quality output, ideal for users who prefer simpler interfaces over full-featured recording tools.

Camtasia stands out with its combination of advanced recording capabilities and comprehensive editing features. While primarily known for its detailed editing tools, Camtasia can also capture web content effectively, giving users the flexibility to handle both creation and manipulation of recorded material in one application.

These alternatives effectively bridge the gap for users whose direct download options are restricted due to platform limitations or specific video characteristics. Users choosing an alternative recording method should ensure compatibility with their operating system and recording requirements for the best results.


## Common Issues and Solutions

When downloading a Loom video through the platform causes playback issues, users have multiple effective troubleshooting options available. The most reliable solution is to utilize VLC Media Player, which supports a wide array of video formats and can often resolve compatibility problems that arise with default browser players.

Network connectivity also significantly impacts the download process. Users experiencing slow speeds should verify their internet connection quality and switch to a more reliable network if possible. For optimal performance, particularly with larger files approaching the 20GB maximum limit, users are advised to download videos using a wired connection or a Wi-Fi network with known high-speed capabilities.

A common issue users face is video quality degradation, particularly when viewing downloaded files in Loom's default 16:9 web player. This is easily addressable by adjusting the aspect ratio settings in the video player configuration. Changing the screen resolution to 16:9 prior to downloading ensures proper display and prevents the player from stretching the content unnecessarily.

For users encountering permission-related errors when attempting to download videos, ensuring proper authentication status is crucial. Attempting to download without a valid Loom account, or while signed into the incorrect workspace, will prevent access to the download feature. Additionally, verifying that the video owner has enabled download permissions through their account settings can resolve cases where the Download button is missing.


## Additional Considerations for Downloaded Videos

Downloaded Loom videos maintain their original trims but exclude certain interactive elements. These AI-powered enhancements, including call-to-action buttons (CTAs) and Filler Word + Silence removal features, are stripped from the downloaded content. Similarly, videos are delivered without chapters or closed captioning functionality, though the downloaded files retain their full audiovisual content.

Users should pay particular attention to aspect ratio considerations when viewing downloaded content. Loom's default web player displays videos in a 16:9 format, which can cause natural stretching of videos recorded in different aspect ratios. To maintain proper proportions, users should ensure their screen resolution is set to 16:9 before downloading videos. This adjustment ensures that videos retain their original visual integrity without distortion, though users recording content specifically for Loom should consider setting their camera or display to the 16:9 ratio from the outset.
