# Canva Video Embedding Guide

When sharing visual content online, video has become an increasingly popular format for engaging audiences and conveying messages effectively. Platforms like YouTube have transformed the way we consume information, making it possible to share detailed explanations, brand stories, and creative expressions instantly. However, the challenge remains for designers and content creators to integrate these dynamic elements seamlessly into their projects without losing functionality when the content is shared or distributed.

Canva understands this challenge and has developed multiple approaches to embedding videos that work across their design ecosystem. This guide explores the best practices for adding videos to Canva designs, including direct embedding methods and alternative link-based solutions. We'll examine what works within Canva's editing environment versus what maintains functionality when the design is exported or shared, helping creators make informed decisions based on their specific needs. Whether you're creating social media posts, presentations, or comprehensive design projects, understanding these embedding options will help you deliver the most effective visual experiences to your audience.


## Canva Direct Embed Methods

Canva directly supports embedding videos through its built-in applications, primarily from YouTube. To embed a YouTube video, users should select the 'Apps' option from the toolbar, find and activate the 'YouTube' application, and then select the desired video from their channel or playlist. Once embedded, the video can be resized and positioned like any other design element.

However, this direct embedding method has key limitations. The video can only be played within Canva's editing interface and not when exporting the design. Attempting to download the design as PDF, JPEG, MP4, or PPTX formats results in the video functionality being stripped out of the exported file. The video appears static in these formats with no play capabilities.

For users who need to share designs with videos that maintain play functionality, Canva provides an alternative method: adding a clickable link to an image or shape. This approach requires inserting an image, text, or shape into the design, then using Canva's Link button to add a hyperlink. The YouTube video URL is pasted into this hyperlink field. When the embedded link is clicked in a PDF download or shared design, it opens the video in a web browser.

This workaround is particularly useful for presentations or designs intended for downloading or sharing outside of Canva's live editing environment. While it slightly reduces the design's interactive elements, it ensures that the video content remains functional and viewable to the final audience.


## YouTube Embed Best Practices

For embedding YouTube videos in Canva, users must ensure they use the full URL rather than shortened versions. The video can be embedded either by pasting the URL directly into the canvas or by utilizing Canva's integrated YouTube app through the Apps menu.

Once embedded, the video can be resized and positioned like any other design element. While playback functionality is preserved within Canva's interface, videos embedded using the direct link or app methods do not retain their playability when the design is downloaded as PDF Print, PDF Standard, JPEG, MP4 Video, or PPTX formats.

To maintain video functionality in shared designs, users should create a clickable link to the video instead. This involves inserting an image, text, or shape into the design and using Canva's Link button to add a hyperlink. When implemented correctly, this method ensures that clicking the link in a downloaded PDF or shared design plays the video in a web browser.

Users should test the playback functionality regularly to ensure proper operation, particularly when making design modifications. The embedded videos can be customized through resizing, positioning, and alignment options, though their content cannot be edited directly within Canva.

For presentations or designs intended for broader distribution, it's crucial to verify both the URL accuracy and the intended viewing method. Proper implementation ensures that the video content remains viewable and interactive for all intended audiences.


## External Embedding Options

Canva supports embedding videos from platforms including Vimeo, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. The process generally follows these steps:

1. Access the Embed app from the left-side menu in Canva, then select the platform containing the video you wish to embed.

2. Copy the video URL from your hosting platform's page.

3. Paste this URL directly into the Embed app's input field within Canva.

4. Position the embedded video as needed using Canva's resizing and positioning tools.

5. Preview your design to ensure proper placement and sizing of the embedded content.

Specific platform requirements include:

- YouTube: Supports regular videos, live streams, and playlists

- TikTok: Only supports live video embedding

- Instagram: Can embed Reels and IGTV content

- Facebook: Allows embedding both live and recorded videos

Additional platform compatibility exists for Tumblr, Twitch, and LinkedIn, with similar embedding procedures. For Shopify integration, users can follow these steps:

1. Download the EmbedAny app from the Canva app store

2. Navigate to Shopify's Online Store settings and select 'Customize' on the themes page

3. Add a new section from the left control pane and select the EmbedAny app

4. Paste your TikTok link into the text field provided

5. The link will transform into an interactive widget within your Shopify theme

When embedding videos from these external sources, keep in mind that while the content appears and resizes within Canva, the video functionality is lost when downloading the design as PDF Print, PDF Standard, JPEG, MP4 Video, or PPTX formats. Designers should follow the second embedding method described earlier: inserting a clickable link to the video content, ensuring proper testing and validation of the embedded content's functionality across intended viewing platforms.


## Website Embedding

To embed videos in a Canva website, the platform provides an Embed app that allows integration from various sources including YouTube, Vimeo, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. This app-based approach enables designers to include dynamic content while maintaining website functionality.

The basic process involves:

1. Accessing the Embed app via Canva's left-side menu

2. Copying the video URL from the hosting platform

3. Pasting the URL into the Embed app's input field

4. Positioning the embedded video as needed

5. Previewing and publishing the website

The app supports different content types from each platform:

- YouTube: Regular videos, live streams, and playlists

- TikTok: Live videos exclusively

- Instagram: Reels and IGTV content

- Facebook: Both live and recorded videos

Additional platform support exists for Tumblr, Twitch, and LinkedIn, with similar embedding procedures. For Shopify integration, designers should use the EmbedAny app:

1. Download the EmbedAny app from Canva's app store

2. Navigate to Shopify's Online Store settings and select 'Customize' on the themes page

3. Add a new section from the left control pane and select the EmbedAny app

4. Paste your TikTok link into the text field provided

5. The link converts into an interactive widget within your Shopify theme

When embedding videos from these sources, it's important to note that while content appears and resizes within Canva, playback functionality is lost when downloading the design as PDF Print, PDF Standard, JPEG, MP4 Video, or PPTX formats. This limitation emphasizes the importance of using the second embedding method described earlier: inserting a clickable link to the video content. This approach ensures that viewers who access the website through methods other than Canva's live environment can still play the video content in their web browser.
