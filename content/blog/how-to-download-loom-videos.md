# How to Download Loom Videos

Loom has become a popular platform for recording short videos, but what happens when you want to keep a video beyond its initial playback? Downloading Loom videos isn't always straightforward, especially when you factor in account restrictions and technical limitations. In this article, we'll walk you through the basics of downloading Loom videos, explore alternative methods for restricted content, and help you troubleshoot common issues. Whether you're a Business user managing team recordings or an individual looking to keep a personal video, we'll cover everything you need to know about downloading Loom videos, from the simple cases to the more complex scenarios.


## Basic Download Process

To download a Loom video, you typically need to follow these steps based on your account level and the video permissions:


### Account-Based Download Process

1. Navigate to the video via shareable link or Loom dashboard

2. For videos you own:

   - Locate the "Download" button below the video and click it

   - The video will be saved as an MP4 file in your default download folder (usually "Downloads" on PCs and Macs)

3. For videos from others' accounts:

   - Use the shared Loom link in your browser

   - Click the three stacked dots (â‹®) in the lower right of the video window

   - Select "Download" if available


### Alternative Methods for Restricted Access

If the video does not have download access enabled:

1. Use screen recording software like OBS Studio, Tella, or Camtasia

2. Open OBS and create a new scene

3. Add Display Capture source and set to web browser window

4. Open Loom video in web browser

5. Start recording in OBS

6. Play video

7. Stop recording in OBS

8. Find recording in Video folder on PC


### Technical Requirements and Limitations

Video downloads are restricted to files under 20GB, which limits the maximum length to approximately 3 hours in 4K quality. The downloaded video maintains its original aspect ratio, which may appear stretched in Loom's 16:9 web player. Users are advised to record videos in 16:9 ratio or adjust screen resolution to avoid aspect ratio issues.


### Legal Considerations

Content rights must be respected during the downloading process. Unauthorized downloading can violate copyrights. The downloaded video should only be used for personal or educational purposes as per Loom's terms of service.


## Download Methods for Different Account Levels

Business and Enterprise users within the respective workspaces have access to video downloads through the Loom dashboard. All downloaded videos maintain their original aspect ratio, which may appear stretched in Loom's 16:9 web player. Users are advised to record videos in 16:9 format or adjust screen resolution to avoid aspect ratio issues.

The download process varies slightly based on whether the video belongs to the account holder or another user. Personal videos are accessed directly through the Loom dashboard or shareable link, with the "Download" button located in the video toolbar. When downloading someone else's video, users must enable download access in the video settings and ensure they are signed into their Loom account.

Account level restrictions apply to Creator Lite users, who cannot download videos from Business, Business+ AI, or Starter Free workspaces. However, administrators in these environments retain download access for videos under 20GB. Multiple recording sessions may affect download availability, potentially causing temporary restrictions.

Alternative methods include screen recording software like OBS Studio, Tella, or Camtasia. Users create a new scene, add Display Capture, and set the web browser window as the capture source. This method allows playback while recording, though the process requires manual management of video files. Other free tools include EaseUS Video Downloader and getof.net, though these options may contain ads or be less reliable than official methods.


## Alternative Download Tools and Software

Download tools vary in functionality and compatibility, with each offering specific advantages. SurFast Video Downloader stands out for its comprehensive approach, supporting over 1000 streaming sites including Loom. The process is straightforward: users copy the Loom video URL, paste it into the software, select 1080p format, and initiate the download. The tool processes files efficiently without displaying ads, making it particularly user-friendly for bulk downloads.

Alternative approaches leverage browser extensions and online services, though these methods carry certain limitations. The EaseUS Video Downloader, for example, enables quick downloads through its web interface. After installing the extension, users select the desired video quality before clicking the download icon. However, this method is restricted to public videos, requiring admin permissions for private content.

For developers or users seeking command-line capabilities, the EcomGraduates/loom-downloader Node.js tool provides a powerful solution. By cloning the GitHub repository and installing necessary dependencies, users can download videos programmatically via video ID. The process requires technical understanding but offers flexibility for automation and batch operations. The tool supports multiple download options, including custom filenames and directories, making it suitable for both individual and organizational use.


## Common Issues and Solutions

Common issues and solutions include:

- Download button not available: Verify that you have the necessary permissions to download the video. Downloads are restricted to administrators and creators unless specifically enabled for other users.

- Video not playing after download: Try using a different video player or updating your current player. VLC Media Player supports wider video formats that may resolve aspect ratio issues when playing downloaded videos.

- Slow download speed: Ensure you have a stable, high-speed internet connection. Download speeds can be affected by your internet service provider's upload bandwidth limitations.

- Video quality dropped: Adjust your video player's resolution settings to match the intended quality. Loom maintains the original video quality during the download process, but player settings can affect playback appearance.

Additional considerations for troubleshooting:

- If you encounter download errors, particularly with private videos, ensure you are signed into your Loom account. Private videos can only be downloaded by users who have been granted download access in the video settings.

- Loom enforces a maximum file size limit of 20GB, which restricts the maximum length of downloadable videos to approximately 3 hours in 4K quality. Attempting to download videos longer than this may result in partial downloads or download failures.

- Multiple recording sessions in close succession may temporarily affect download availability. If you consistently encounter download restrictions, contact Loom support or check your account for any recent changes that may impact file access.
