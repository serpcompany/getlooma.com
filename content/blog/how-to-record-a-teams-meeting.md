# Recording Microsoft Teams Meetings

Teams meetings, while valuable for collaboration, often lack convenient recording options. Microsoft's built-in solution and third-party alternatives vary significantly in functionality, requiring careful consideration based on organizational needs and legal requirements. This guide examines Microsoft Teams' recording methods, permission structures, and practical applications to help organizations make informed decisions about their meeting capture strategies.


## Recording Methods

Microsoft Teams provides multiple methods for recording meetings, including built-in functionality and third-party tools.


### Built-In Recording Feature

The built-in recording feature requires an active Microsoft Office license and must be enabled by IT administrators. This feature captures audio, video, and screen sharing content for meetings hosted on both Mac and PC platforms. When recording, meeting participants receive a notification that the recording has begun, and recordings automatically stop when the meeting concludes. These recordings save to OneDrive for one-on-one or small group meetings and to SharePoint for channel meetings. The standard recording feature has limitations, including a maximum duration of 4 hours or 1.5 GB, after which recordings automatically stop and restart.


### Third-Party Screen Recording Tools

Several third-party tools offer additional capabilities beyond what is available in Teams, including enhanced recording, transcription, and editing features. OBS Studio provides free, open-source screen capture functionality that can be used to record Teams meetings. Users can create a new scene in OBS Studio, add a display capture source to focus on the Teams meeting window, and start recording directly from the application. These tools require manual setup and configuration, and users must obtain verbal consent from meeting participants before initiating recordings.


### Alternative Recording Options

For users unable to utilize the built-in recording feature, alternative methods include Microsoft Stream integration and other third-party applications. Microsoft Stream allows recording up to 15 minutes and requires a paid subscription. Stream saves recordings in OneDrive or SharePoint and provides basic screen recording capabilities. Meeting participants must give informed consent before being recorded, and recording options include both audio-only and screen recording modes.


### Meeting Recording Permissions

Recording permissions are controlled at multiple levels within Teams. The meeting organizer typically has default recording ability, though organizational IT administrators can restrict or grant these permissions as needed. Guests and external attendees without specific recording permissions will not see recording options in Teams. For individual users, meeting recording requires an appropriate license type: Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, Business Essentials, M365 Business, or Business Premium plans enable recording capabilities.


## Permissions and Requirements

The built-in recording feature requires specific licensing and administrator approval. All users must have an Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, Business Essentials, M365 Business, or Business Premium license, though meeting organizers typically have permission by default. IT administrators control the recording feature, enabling it for users as needed.

Microsoft Teams distinguishes between meeting organizers and participants with recording capabilities. Organizers and users granted specific permissions may initiate recordings, while guests and external attendees require explicit consent. The one-party consent model generally applies in the United States, though two-party consent requirements exist in certain jurisdictions including the UK and India.

Recording permissions allow control at multiple organizational levels. Administrators can configure policies to enable or disable recording for guests, all users, or specific roles. The recording feature requires meeting organizers to notify participants before starting; automatic notifications inform attendees of recording initiation. Third-party compliance tools enable recording for external participants, regardless of organizational policies.

When recording from another organization or as an anonymous participant, permission from both organizations' administrators is necessary. Meeting organizers with Teams Premium licenses have additional control options, while third-party tools like Tactiq handle transcription and audio correction capabilities beyond standard Teams functionality.


## Recording Process

The built-in recording feature enables straightforward meeting capture for authorized users. When joining or initiating a Teams meeting, participants with recording permissions can access the feature through the meeting controls menu. By selecting "Start recording," users enable live transcriptions and begin capturing audio, video, and screen sharing content.

The recording process notifies all participants of its initiation, and the feature automatically stops when the meeting concludes. On desktop systems, the recording icon appears in the meeting toolbar as a red indicator; on web versions, it requires administrator permission to access. In Teams meetings, recordings save to OneDrive for individual conversations and SharePoint for channel discussions. Channel recordings also include meeting chat history for better context management.


## Storage and Access

The recordings are stored in either the meeting organizer's OneDrive or SharePoint, depending on whether the meeting is private or channel-based. Channel recordings are stored in the respective channel's SharePoint folder, while private meetings save recordings in the organizer's OneDrive under a Recordings folder.

Organizers own the recordings and have full edit rights, allowing them to change permissions and share recordings with others. Permissions for viewing and downloading recordings vary based on participant role and meeting type:

- Team members receive viewing permissions for channel meetings

- Invited users have access to private meetings

- Guests and external attendees can only view recordings if explicitly shared by the organizer


### Expiration Settings

Recordings retain value for 60 days by default before expiring. Administrators or users can extend or remove this expiration period:

1. Click the recording link in the meeting chat

2. Select the expiration countdown beneath the recording date

3. Choose to extend, select, or remove the expiration


### Access and Review

Organizers and recording initiators maintain control over content. In the Teams calendar, recordings appear in the Recordings and Transcripts tab, making them easily accessible for review. Users can play recordings directly in Teams or download them for offline viewing.


### Transcription and Search

Microsoft Teams generates machine-generated voice transcriptions during recordings. These transcripts appear alongside recordings, enabling quick content review. Users can search recordings using Microsoft 365 Search functionality, though transcripts may not capture all meeting content, particularly whiteboards, notes, and PowerPoint animations.


## Transcription and Editing

Transcriptions and built-in tools enable efficient meeting management. During meetings, automatic transcription captures every word, displaying the transcript alongside the recording. This feature particularly benefits users with hearing impairments and improves meeting productivity by automatically generating notes, timestamps, and details without requiring manual recording.

The transcription process begins by selecting the "Record and transcribe" option from the meeting controls menu. Microsoft Teams then automatically generates a transcript that appears on the right side of the meeting screen in real-time. After the meeting concludes, the transcript remains available, providing valuable meeting documentation.

Beyond basic transcription, third-party tools offer extensive editing capabilities. Descript, for example, allows quick edits with a single backspace key and professional audio cleanup through its Studio Sound feature. Users can remove filler words like "um," "uh," and "like" while adding titles, overlays, transitions, music, and effects to enhance the final recording.

Supernormal provides particularly advanced features for organizations requiring comprehensive meeting capture. By enabling "Take notes for Zoom and Teams meetings" in Account Settings, Supernormal automatically transcribes all meetings with speaker labeling and time-stamping. The platform captures audio, video, and chat for complete records, making it suitable for critical discussions where detailed documentation is essential.

Organizations should consider these tools when planning meeting recording strategies, as built-in features have limitations. Native Teams recordings cannot be edited or trimmed within the platform, requiring external video editing tools for any necessary modifications. However, the combination of built-in transcription capabilities and third-party editing solutions provides comprehensive support for Teams meeting management.
