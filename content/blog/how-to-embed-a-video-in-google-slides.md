# How to Embed a Video in Google Slides

Google Slides revolutionizes presentation creation by seamlessly integrating videos into your slideshows. Whether you're sharing a hilarious meme, presenting research findings, or showcasing a product demo, embedding videos makes your presentations more engaging and informative. This comprehensive guide walks you through the process of adding videos from YouTube and Google Drive, plus tips for customizing playback and visual elements to match your presentation style. Whether you're a first-time presenter or a seasoned slide master, these steps will help you include videos that captivate your audience and enhance your message.


## YouTube Integration

Google Slides supports embedding YouTube videos through both URL pasting and search-based methods. To embed a video using these approaches, users first need internet access, as the platform streams videos directly from YouTube rather than downloading them.

For search-based embedding, users begin by accessing Google Slides and selecting the target slide. They then click the "Insert" button in the top toolbar and choose "Insert Video" from the dropdown menu. Entering keywords or the video title in the search bar enables quick video selection, though users can also paste a direct URL into the same search field for immediate insertion.

The platform provides several customization options for embedded videos, including playback settings and visual adjustments. For instance, users can control whether the video plays on click, automatically, or manually, and set specific start and end times to play only certain sections of the video. Additional visual customizations include adjusting the video's size and rotation, applying drop shadow effects, and managing pixel-level positioning on the slide.

Google Slides also supports embedding videos directly from Google Drive, offering flexibility for users who prefer not to use YouTube. These videos maintain their functionality within presentations, playing automatically if they contain audio and respecting the same customization options available for YouTube-embedded content. The process involves uploading the video to Google Drive, navigating to the target slide in the presentation, and selecting "Insert Video" followed by "Google Drive" in the dropdown menu to browse and insert the desired file.


## Google Drive Integration

Google Slides enables embedding videos directly from Google Drive, offering several advantages over YouTube embedding methods. Users begin by uploading the desired video file to Google Drive, following which they navigate to the target slide in their presentation and select "Insert Video" from the Insert menu. The platform specifically recommends uploading videos to a dedicated folder for organization.

After selecting Google Drive from the video insertion menu, users browse their Drive content to locate the uploaded video. The document notes that videos can be inserted from multiple locations within Drive, including "Browse My Drive," "Shared Drives," "Shared with Me," and the "Recent" tab, allowing for flexible content management.

Once selected, the video appears on the slide with several essential customization options available through the right sidebar. These include basic playback controls such as enabling automatic play, setting specific start and end times, and muting audio. Additionally, users can adjust the video's size, rotation, and position using precise pixel-level controls. The documentation specifically mentions the ability to lock aspect ratios during scaling and apply drop shadows with customizable opacity, position (angle), distance, and blur radius.

While the platform supports standard MP4 format for maximum compatibility, users should ensure uploaded videos maintain clear audio quality, particularly for presentations that rely on spoken content. The integration process requires an active internet connection for YouTube videos, as these stream directly from the platform. However, Google Drive videos play automatically if the file contains audio content, streamlining presentation flow without manual interaction.


## Basic Embedding Methods

The basic embedding process begins with selecting the target slide in the Google Slides presentation. Users then click the Insert button in the top toolbar and choose Video from the dropdown menu, locating the By URL option for YouTube videos or the Google Drive tab for locally stored files.

For YouTube videos, users first copy the video URL from the address bar. They then open the presentation, select the target slide, click Insert > Video, and choose the By URL tab in the dialogue box. Here, they paste the copied URL and click Select to complete the embedding process.

Alternatively, videos can be directly uploaded from Google Drive. Users initiate this process by accessing their Google Drive account, navigating to the location of the video file, and selecting the File upload option in the Google Drive interface. After uploading the video to Google Drive, users return to their Google Slides presentation, click Insert > Video, and choose Google Drive from the dropdown menu. They then browse their Drive content, selecting the video file and clicking Insert to add it to the presentation.

Once embedded, videos can be positioned and resized using precise pixel-level controls. Users select the video object in the presentation, and red handles appear at each corner for resizing. The right sidebar displays a Format options panel where users can adjust the video's size by entering specific width and height values, lock the aspect ratio during scaling, and apply drop shadow effects with customizable opacity, position, angle, and blur radius.

For external video links, users can create a link by highlighting the desired text or object on a slide, right-clicking, and selecting Link. They then paste the video URL into the link box, check the box to display the title instead of the raw URL, and click Apply to create the link. During presentation mode, viewers can click on this linked text to open the video in a new tab or window, though an active internet connection is required for playback.

Google Slides supports embedding from multiple sources, including Vimeo and other platforms, though the process may vary slightly. For Vimeo videos, users can take a screenshot of the desired frame, insert it into the slide, and add a hyperlink using the Insert Link feature. They then paste the Vimeo video URL into the link box and adjust settings as needed. This method allows integration of external content while maintaining presentation flow.


## Customization Options

Customizing embedded videos in Google Slides allows presenters to control playback and improve visual presentation. Users can set start and end times to play specific sections of a video, with options to enable automatic play, manual play, or play on click. The platform respects these settings while maintaining compatibility with both YouTube and Google Drive sources.

Video size and rotation adjustments enable precise integration with slide layouts. The system allows users to change width and height values directly, lock aspect ratios during scaling, and apply rotations or horizontal/vertical flips without distorting the content. These adjustments maintain visual consistency across different screen sizes and presentation environments.

The customization options extend to positioning controls, allowing users to set reference points for X and Y coordinate adjustments. Slides provides two primary options for reference points: top left and center positioning, with pixel-level precision available for fine-tuning. These controls help maintain visual flow and avoid overlap with text or other elements.

Additional visual customizations include drop shadow effects with comprehensive control over shadow appearance. Users can adjust shadow color, opacity, distance from the video border, and blur radius to enhance visual separation while maintaining professional presentation standards. The system also allows users to enable or disable drop shadows based on design preferences.

Text enhancements further improve video accessibility and integration. Users can add alt text descriptions for screen readers and provide video titles for context when viewed online. These text elements help maintain presentation flow while supporting users who cannot play embedded videos.

Playback controls remain accessible through a right-sidebar panel known as Format options. Here, users can adjust start and end times with precise timestamps, control audio through mute options, and manage video behavior during presentations. The system maintains these settings across different device environments, ensuring consistent playback experience.


## Mobile Integration

Google Slides supports multiple methods for adding videos from mobile devices, primarily through screenshots and linking. For Android users, the process begins by uploading videos to Google Drive or copying YouTube URLs directly. Users then take a screenshot of the desired video frame, crop it to the appropriate size, and use the Google Slides app to insert the cropped image. By tapping the "+" icon and selecting "Link," users can paste the original video URL into the URL bar, ensuring the cropped image acts as a clickable thumbnail that opens the full video during presentation mode.

For iPhone users, the process includes several steps. Videos must first be uploaded to Google Drive or provided as a YouTube URL. Users capture an engaging frame as a screenshot and crop it to the desired size, acting as the video thumbnail. When opening Google Slides on their iPhone, users select the target slide and tap the "+" icon, choosing "Image > from photos" to add the cropped screenshot. Following this, users select "Link" and paste the video URL from Google Drive or YouTube. The system then creates a clickable thumbnail that, when activated during presentation mode, redirects users to the full video content.

This integration method maintains compatibility with both YouTube and Google Drive sources, allowing presenters to maintain consistent visual elements while ensuring the video content plays seamlessly during presentations. The system respects playback settings and customization options applied to other embedded content, providing a cohesive presentation experience across mobile and desktop platforms.
