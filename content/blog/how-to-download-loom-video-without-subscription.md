# Downloading Loom Videos

Video sharing platforms have revolutionized how we consume content online, but proprietary formats and restricted access present challenges for users who need to retain or repurpose this content. Loom, a popular screen recording tool, exemplifies these limitations, offering download capabilities that are contingent on specific account tiers and video owner permissions. This comprehensive guide navigates the technical and strategic considerations for obtaining Loom videos, from understanding built-in features to employing robust third-party solutions that respect both user needs and content creators' rights. Whether you're a free user seeking access to your own recordings or an administrator managing multiple accounts, this article provides the detailed guidance needed to overcome Loom's download restrictions while maintaining control over your workflow.


## Built-in Download Features

Loom provides built-in download features for its videos, though access is restricted to certain account types. Personal videos can be downloaded directly from your account by navigating to them via shareable link or Loom dashboard and clicking the Download button in the toolbar. The video is saved as an MP4 file in your browser's default Downloads folder, typically found under "Downloads" on both Windows and Mac systems.

For videos from other accounts, you must first ensure that downloads are enabled by the video owner. If they are, you can access the Download button in a similar manner to personal videos. If downloads are disabled, you can still acquire the video using screen recording software like OBS Studio, Tella, or Camtasia. To use this method, download and install the chosen software, create a new scene, set the source to Display Capture, select your web browser window, open the Loom video in your browser, start the recording, play the video, stop recording when finished, and locate the recorded video in the software's output folder.


### Requirements and Limitations

Loom restricts downloads to files under 20GB, preventing the capture of larger video files. The platform requires permission from the video owner to enable download functionality, ensuring that creators retain control over their content. For free users or account creators who do not have download access, third-party solutions become necessary. These include dedicated video downloaders like Cisdem Video Converter and online services such as Fordownloader.com and Pastedownload.com. While these tools vary in their features and user experience, they offer alternative methods for obtaining Loom videos that otherwise would be unavailable for download.


## Alternative Download Methods

For users who cannot enable download access through Loom's built-in features, third-party tools offer viable alternatives. Cisdem Video Converter stands out among dedicated downloaders, supporting both direct downloads and batch processing from over 1,000 websites including Loom. This comprehensive toolchain allows users to select video quality up to 4K, choose custom save folders, and even edit videos directly within the software before downloading.

Online services provide a simpler alternative but come with inherent trade-offs. Fordownloader.com, for instance, offers the benefit of no pop-ups but limits users to downloading files in their original quality without the ability to choose between WebM VP9 or MP4 formats. This tool proves particularly useful for quick access to public or protected videos requiring login authentication.

While effective, using online downloaders carries risks of exposure to malicious content. Users should exercise caution and consider the security implications when leveraging these free services. For those who require frequent downloads or specific editing capabilities, investment in dedicated download software like Cisdem ensures both security and functionality.

## Common Issues and Solutions

To troubleshoot common issues, first verify if you have the necessary permissions to download the video. If you created the video but cannot download it, check your account settings to ensure you have the required subscription level. For videos from other accounts, confirm that the owner has enabled download access.

If you encounter problems with specific download tools, consider the following solutions:

- For Cisdem Video Converter users experiencing connection errors, ensure your internet connection is stable and try running the software as administrator.

- If Fordownloader.com fails to fetch videos, clear your browser cache and cookies, then try downloading from a different browser or device.

- For issues with Chrome extensions like Download Master or Save From, uninstall them and install a dedicated video downloading software instead.

For users attempting to download transcripts and captions:

- Ensure you have the latest version of the Loom browser extension installed.

- Copy the transcript text immediately after opening the video, as transcripts may disappear if the video reaches the end of its playback period.

- When using an SRT converter tool, save the file with a descriptive name in a convenient location for future reference.

By understanding these common issues and appropriate solutions, users can overcome obstacles when downloading Loom videos and ensure they have access to the content they need.
