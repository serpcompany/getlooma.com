# How to Download Loom Videos

Loom has revolutionized collaboration through its video comments and recordings, but the platform comes with specific limitations - particularly when it comes to downloading videos. While some users, like administrators and workspace creators, can download their recordings seamlessly, others face restrictions. This comprehensive guide walks you through the process of downloading Loom videos, whether you have direct access or need alternative solutions. We'll explore everything from using built-in download features to advanced command-line tools, ensuring you have all the options to get the videos you need.


## Downloading Your Own Videos

Loom restricts video downloads to specific user roles and size limitations. Administrators and creators in Business/Business+ AI, Education, and Enterprise workspaces have download access, while Creator Lites in these environments do not. The download process varies based on whether the uploader has enabled this feature:

For videos with download enabled, access the video via Loom link or dashboard, locate the "Download" button in the toolbar below the video, and click it to save the file as an MP4 in your default Downloads folder.

The 20GB limit applies to individual files, meaning approximately 3 hours of 4K video at most can be downloaded. Keep in mind that videos containing Loom's Variable feature or meeting recordings require special access. Meeting organizers have permission to download recordings, while other users must contact the organizer for access.

When downloading from someone else's account, follow these steps:

1. Access the video via the shared Loom link

2. Click the three stacked dots in the lower-right corner

3. Select "Download" if available

4. Save file according to your browser's settings

For videos where downloads are restricted, consider using screen recording software like OBS Studio, Tella, or Camtasia. These tools allow you to capture the Loom video playing in your browser window as a new recording.

The original aspect ratio is preserved in downloaded videos, which may appear stretched in Loom's default 16:9 player. To view the video correctly, adjust your screen resolution to match the original aspect ratio. If you encounter issues with corrupt downloads or missing elements like CTAs or closed captions, these download limitations may be to blame.


## Download Restrictions and Limitations

The ability to download Loom videos is restricted to specific user roles within Business/Business+ AI, Education, and Enterprise workspaces - administrators and creators have permission while Creator Lites do not. For videos with download enabled, users access the feature through the "Download" button in the video toolbar, saving files as MP4s in their default Downloads folder. Each video is subject to a 20GB size limit, roughly equivalent to 3 hours of 4K content.

Videos containing Loom's Variable feature or meeting recordings require special access, with only meeting organizers able to download recordings. Other users must contact organizers for access. When viewing shared videos, users with download permission can click three stacked dots in the lower-right corner to access the Download option. If downloads are restricted, viewers can use screen recording software like OBS Studio, Tella, or Camtasia to capture the video as a new recording in their browser window.

Viewer access requirements further restrict download capabilities - only paid workspace creators/admins can enable this feature, while viewers must sign into Loom to download. Unauthenticated users cannot access video content regardless of settings. Additional limitations apply to videos using Loom's Variable feature or meeting recordings restricted to organizers only. The downloaded MP4 maintains the original aspect ratio, which may appear stretched in Loom's default 16:9 player. Users are advised to adjust their screen resolution to match the original 16:9 aspect ratio for proper display.


## Alternative Download Methods

When direct download isn't available, screen recording software offers a practical alternative. Tools like OBS Studio, Tella, and Camtasia capture the Loom video playing in your browser window as a new recording. This method preserves video quality while allowing flexibility in editing and post-processing.

For technical users, command-line tools provide automation capabilities. The loom-downloader Node.js tool retrieves video download links based on the video ID, saving files with customizable names. To use this tool, ensure Node.js and npm are installed, then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/EcomGraduates/loom-downloader.git`

2. Install npm packages: `npm install`

Once installed, download a video using the command: `loom-dl --url https://www.loom.com/share/[VideoId]`. Replace [VideoId] with the actual video ID from the URL. The video will save as [VideoId].mp4 by default. For custom filenames, use the --out or -o option: `loom-dl --url [VideoId] --out [FileName].mp4` or specify an output path: `loom-dl --url [VideoId] --out path/to/[FileName].mp4`

Web-based services like PasteDownload offer additional options for those who prefer a browser-based solution. This platform handles Loom video downloads safely without requiring software installations or storing personal information. All processing occurs in real-time, with files transferred directly to your device in their original quality ranging from 480p to 1080p. For maximum compatibility, downloads save in the standard MP4 format, with audio extraction available when appropriate.


## Common Issues and Solutions

Common issues when downloading Loom videos include playback problems, slow download speeds, and quality degradation. To troubleshoot these problems, users should try different video players or obtain a faster internet connection. If video quality drops, resolution settings should be adjusted in the player.

When encountering missing download buttons, users should verify their permission level - only workspace administrators and creators have download access. For videos that cannot be downloaded directly, screen recording software offers a practical alternative. Recommended tools include OBS Studio, Tella, and Camtasia. These applications allow users to capture the Loom video playing in their browser window as a new recording, preserving original quality.

Additional issues may arise from technical limitations specific to Loom video characteristics. Videos containing the company's Variable feature or meeting recordings require special access. Meeting organizers own download permissions, while other users must contact organizers for access. For videos exceeding 20GB - roughly 3 hours in 4K - unauthorized downloading is not possible due to size restrictions.

In cases where the download process appears stuck, users should check their URL for accuracy and ensure content remains publicly accessible. Troubleshooting may also involve switching browsers, as compatibility issues can affect the download process. Users experiencing persistent errors are advised to clear their browser cache, which may contain conflicting old data. For more complex issues, contacting Loom support provides the best resolution path. Support maintains a policy of addressing reported issues within 24 hours, assisted by detailed user submissions including URL, browser information, and error messages.

PasteDownload offers further assistance through its web-based service, providing a secure alternative to traditional download methods. This platform processes downloads in real-time without requiring software installations or storing personal information. For users preferring command-line operations, the loom-downloader Node.js tool offers powerful automation capabilities. After installing Node.js and npm, users can clone the repository and install necessary packages before using the tool to retrieve video links based on the video ID. This method allows for customized filename options and batch downloads, making it a valuable resource for technical users seeking complete control over their download processes.


## Advanced Download Options

For automated downloads, users with technical expertise can employ tools like loom-downloader, a Node.js command-line solution. After installing Node.js and npm, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/EcomGraduates/loom-downloader.git` and install the necessary packages with `npm install`. This tool retrieves video download links using the video ID, with options for customizable filenames and batch downloads.

Web-based services provide an alternative for users preferring a browser-based approach. PasteDownload, for instance, offers real-time processing and direct file transfer to the user's device without requiring software installations or storing personal information. Supported video qualities range from 480p to 1080p, with standard MP4 format for universal compatibility and optional audio extraction when appropriate. The platform processes unlimited downloads without registration requirements or hidden costs, maintaining support through non-intrusive advertising and resolving reported issues within 24 hours.
